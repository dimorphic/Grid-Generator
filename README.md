Grid-Generator
==============

GridGenerator is a simple SASS mixin meant to replace all grids :) From Twitter Bootstrap to Foundation, 960, etc all of them come with a lot of classes that pollute the code.

Using the very cool ‘map’ property that came in SASS v3 http://sass.logdown.com/ we can now create pretty objects to generate only specific grids / grid classes / grid styles.
